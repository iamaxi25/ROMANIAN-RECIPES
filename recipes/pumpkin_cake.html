        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>200g flour</li>
            <li>200g cooked pumpkin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>a pinch of sodium bicarbonate</li>
            <li>80g of sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla essence</li>
            <li>80 ml of oil</li>
            <li>75 ml of milk</li>
            <li>orange peel</li>

        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The pumpkin used in this recipe must be prepared in advance, either boiled or baked. Mash the obtained pumpkin until a fine puree is obtained.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius. Cover the round tray or cake form with a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>In a bowl mix the eggs, vanilla essence, orange peel. Mix until a whitish composition is obtained that doubles in volume.</li>
            <li>Add the oil, milk and cold pumpkin puree. It homogenizes.</li>
            <li>Mix the flour, baking powder and baking soda separately. This mixture is gradually added over the egg mixture. The resulting dough should have the consistency of a slightly thicker pancake batter.</li>
            <li>The cake dough is poured into the form and baked for 40-45 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius or until it passes the toothpick test.</li>
            <li>The pumpkin cake is served after it has cooled.</li>
